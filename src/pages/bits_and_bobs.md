### In Active Development and Released

#### [Underworld Server](https://www.spinninggoblin.com/underworld)
A procedurally generated text adventure-ish game. All playable either via the REST API or a web frontend. If you have an email address, you can play.
  - The [swagger](https://underworldserver.fly.dev/swagger_ui)
  - The [server code](https://github.com/spinnginggoblin/underworld_server)
  - The [core code](https://github.com/SpinningGoblin/underworld_core) - The core logic that Underworld Server relies on. I plan to add more things that use this in the future, like a terminal UI game.
  - The [frontend code](https://github.com.spinninggoblin/underworld)

#### [SpinngingGoblin](https://www.spinninggoblin.com)
It's a spinning pixellated goblin. Eventually will link to other things.

#### [Krustens](https://crates.io/crates/krustens)
Have you ever wanted to take a journey through your Spotify or Apple Music data? You can do it with this. Download and process the data, and see your top artists, or let it suggest some random artists that you've listened to. Get it from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/krustens).
  - The [code](https://github.com/derrickp/krustens)

#### [TuneSage](https://github.com/spinninggoblin/tune_sage)
A fairly light-weight, Rust wrapper around the [MusicBrainz API](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API). Not complete, but works.

#### [tdlg](https://crates.io/crates/tdlg)
It's a top-down level generator! It uses text templates to generate a square map of rooms and empty space. Used by Under Farm and Goblin Hall.

#### [Goblin Hall](https://github.com/SpinningGoblin/goblin_hall)
Another very early stages game. I haven't quite decided exactly what this will be yet, but I'm using it to play around with bevy and do some learning.

### Not as Active Development

#### [Under Farm](https://github.com/derrickp/under_farm)
A very early stages procedurally generated game using the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine. You're a goblin. You can walk around. You can destroy walls and plant crops.
