**Note from Derrick in December 2022** - I'll be writing another post about something similar in the near future which uses the Krustens terminal app I wrote. But read on for what I was thinking in 2020!

Did you know that you can export a bunch of data out of Spotify? Buried inside of Privacy Settings inside your Account page at the very bottom you can ask Spotify to give you a consolidated download copy of your data. It takes a bit of time for them to gather it (for me it was usually 3-5 days), and they only give you about a year of your streaming history (I really wish they'd give me _everything_). Apparently you can contact them for your entire history, but I have not done that yet as I have not felt like it. But, even with only a year's worth of data it can be really interesting to dig through.

## The data

Most of the data is contained inside of various JSON files, and thankfully they all seem to have a fairly simple schema.

### Account data
I didn't find a ton of the account data to be that interesting, but some interesting bits can be found in `Identity.json` such as if you are a `tasteMaker` or not (I am not) and in `Userdata.json` you can find out when your account was created (2015 for me apparently).

### Music/List/Library data

Now we get to the fun bits.

There's a file called `SearchQueries.json` that details where and what you were searching, in addition to what artist you clicked on from the search. For instance I typed "in this" and then have an artist URI in there for "In This Moment", which makes sense. I haven't dug through this file too much yet, but it might be fairly interesting to see where I search the most (I assume Android), and how many characters I use before clicking an artist (and how often I mistype something).

There's a `Follow.json` file, which shows, I think, how many artists and users you follow, and lists the names of the artists as well. Mine is fairly small, as I don't really "follow" that many people in Spotify.

There's a `Playlist.json` file that gives me the full playlist of any ones that I created (super handy) as well as shows some other playlists I've followed (I think?) and one for "Liked from Radio" which I assume is just a Spotify created one. I don't use Playlists all that often other than a couple workout ones and one _massive_ one entitled "Let's Drive!". One interesting thing here, they also tell you if it's from a local file or not, for anyone that uses local files inside of Spotify.

`YourLibrary.json` lists out all of the artists/songs/albums you've added to your Library, which definitely makes me realize I should use this a bit more, as I almost never think about my Library, but could be an interesting way to keep a record of a bunch of artists I want to check out a bit more, and things like that. This also has a section for "shows", "episodes" and "bannedTracks". The banned tracks one was empty for me, but I feel like I should use it more, cause some bands I just don't want to come up.

And finally, the file that I spent the most time reading through, `StreamingHistory0.json`. Specifically for me I wanted to know how many times I listened to all of the different albums.

## Diving through the streaming history

The JSON of the streaming history has a fairly simple structure.

```javascript
{
  "endTime" : "2019-01-02 06:15",
  "artistName" : "Goblinsmoker",
  "trackName" : "Toad King",
  "msPlayed" : 15131
}
```

All that makes sense, when the stream ended, the artist, track and how long you played it for.  For me, when I was digging through the history I focused on songs that I had listened to for more than a minute, I figured if I only listened for 20s, then do I really care? So of the 8000+ songs in my streaming history, there were ~6300 that I had listened to for more than a minute.

Something I wish was in there was the album that the track was listened to on, and since I wanted that album I had to go somewhere else to get it. I probably _could_ have tried to get it out of the Library file I got, but didn't think about that. I also probably could have queried Spotify through an API, but where's the fun in that?! Embrace other things! So to [Musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) I go! Specifically their JSON API, which might not be as full-featured as their XML API but seemed to work fine.

To help with this I wrote 2 very thin wrappers around their JSON endpoints. They work, but probably have bugs. I also only coded bits around the exact parts of the API I actually wanted to use, so probably not helpful for everyone. But hopefully if anyone uses them, they aren't terrible. [Ruby](https://github.com/derrickp/musicz) and [Kotlin](https://github.com/derrickp/musikt).

One thing I found was that it was definitely easier to query the "recording" entities instead of the artist and then get the recordings through that. It felt a little more like going to the source. Almost across the board I was able to always find a recording with a score of 100 (best match possible) by passing in `artistname` and `title` as the query. Some caveats though
1. If the artist name had `&` in it, I needed to replace it with `and`
2. Some of the songs from Spotify had things like `2015 remaster` in it, and I needed to remove that to get any results
3. For some reason if the song title had `'s` or other similar ones and I needed to strip these out. Probably something I am missing.
4. Sometimes, it just broke on titles not quite being right, like `Through the Wall of Light Pt. II` vs `Through the Wall of Light Pt.II`
5. I originally used `artist` instead of `artistname` but found that for some `artist` didn't have the full name in the system

Overall it all worked great, other than getting throttled when I wasn't careful, so I made sure to slow it all down.

There were a few artists that weren't found, and others where it wouldn't find the album, but I worked around that by just recording an `Unknown Album` for those, and if it appeared as a top listen tried to fix manually. Not too many of those though. Things fell apart a bit for songs that appear on tons of albums (like Iron Maiden songs) and I would mark all of the recordings that came back, this wasn't too big an issue for me, but your mileage may vary. Probably something I could also fix with some manual intervention or digging through after. Because I kept all the high-scoring (in terms of relevance) albums, I never lost data, but just reported more albums than I actually listened to. But for me, none of them appeared in my top 10 at all.

A small amount of fun stats!
1. Devin Townsend's Empath was 1/3 of my listens for the year
2. Slipknot's We Are Not Your Kind was 1/6.
3. I should have mentioned Andrew W.K. in my previous blog as I listened to his newest one quite a bit and love it.
4. I listened to the new Baroness album a lot (400+ times), and I like it, but I wish the mixing was better. That's what kept it out of my top of the year lists.
5. I probably didn't listen to TOOL's Fear Inoculum enough (only 66 times)

Here's my top 10 for listens:

1. Devin Townsend, Empath, 2033
2. Slipknot, We Are Not Your Kind, 1081
3. Whitechapel, The Valley, 801
4. Opeth, In Cauda Venenum, 664
5. Andrew W.K., Youâ€™re Not Alone, 637
6. Zeal & Ardor, Stranger Fruit, 584
7. Behemoth, The Satanist, 460
8. Ghost, Prequelle, 448
9. Baroness, Gold & Grey, 448
10. Rivers of Nihil, Where Owls Know My Name, 392

I apparently listened to Ghost a lot, but I just don't think it stayed with me enough at the end of the year to toss it on my top lists. But I still really liked the album.

If you want to see the terrible, terrible code I wrote to get all this info, you can find it [here](https://github.com/derrickp/spotikt).

For my next steps, I think I'm going to get the areas where the artist's are from out of Musicbrainz and start putting them on a map for myself (I love maps), and try to hook up something that will get closer to near-live data out of Spotify.
