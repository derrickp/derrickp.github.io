There were a lot of really great albums released this year. So many that I am finding it hard to pick out a top 10. I listened to a lot of albums, and which are my favourites, or the ones I will keep coming back to, can very much depend on what I'm in the mood to listen to.

So instead of a top 10, I'll just talk briefly about some of the great albums I've listened to this year. These are not necessarily my most listened to, but they are some I want to highlight.

**[Graceless](https://graceless-deathmetal.bandcamp.com/) - Chants from Purgatory** - This album is just a fun, crushing death metal album. It's one that I love putting on when I want to get in a fun groove at work.

**[Kvaen](https://kvaen.bandcamp.com/music) - The Great Below** - I didn't get into their last album as much as this one, but it's also great. This one is fast and furious and a great listen when that's what you're in the mood for.

**[Inexorum](https://inexorum.bandcamp.com/music) - Equinox Vigil** - One of my favourite melodic black metal albums of the year.

**[Freedom of Fear](https://freedomoffear.bandcamp.com/music) - Carpathia** - A late(r) in the year release that I didn't find out about until November. But I listened to it a whole ton of times (for me) since then. Highly recommended.

**[Void Dancer](https://voiddancer.bandcamp.com/music) - Prone Burial** - This came out in April, and I kept playing it all year long. Every time I put it on, I find myself nodding my head to the music.

**[The Devils of Loudun](https://thedevilsofloudun.bandcamp.com/) - Escaping Eternity** - Another one that came out early in the year and I listened to all year long. Great melodic symphonic death metal.

**[Pillaging Villagers](https://pillagingvillagers.bandcamp.com/releases) - Pillaging Villagers** - Great, fun, punk folk metal. This was one I loved cranking during the summer and drinking a beer.

**[Grand Harvest](https://grandharvest.bandcamp.com/music) - Consummatum Est** - Want to listen to some death/doom? One of my favourites in the style this year.

**[Kardashev](https://kardashev.bandcamp.com/music) - Liminal Rite** - Post/black metal that combines a bunch of vocal styles and crushing atmosphere.

**[Revocation](https://revocationband.bandcamp.com/music) - Netherheaven** - More fantastic death metal.

**[Zeal & Ardor](https://zealandardor.bandcamp.com/music) - Zeal & Ardor** - Zeal & Ardor is a band that I've loved for a long time, and they do an amazing live show. I don't know if this album is my favourite of theirs, but I've listened to it the most of any album this year.

#### Some albums from not-2022 I listened to a lot
  - _[1914](https://x1914x.bandcamp.com/music) - Where Fear and Weapons Meet_ - I listened to this album more than almost any album that came out this year. I loved it in 2021, and I still loved it this year.
  - _[Black Sites](https://blacksites.bandcamp.com/music) - Untrue_ - Another one I kept coming back to this year from 2021. Easy to toss on and play it through.
  - _[Earth Rot](https://earthrotaus.bandcamp.com/music) - Black Tides of Obscurity_ - I didn't find out about this until this year, and I wish I had heard it sooner. Such a great album.
  - _[Stormkeep](https://stormkeep.bandcamp.com/releases) - Tales of Othertime_

#### Want some more?
